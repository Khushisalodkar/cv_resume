            <h2>Education</h2>
           <strong> <p>BSc Graduate, CBZ Group (Chemistry, Botany, Zoology) Graduated: 2024</p></strong> <br>
         I hold a Bachelor's degree in the interdisciplinary CBZ (Chemistry, Botany, Zoology) group, which provided me with a strong<br>
         foundation in scientific inquiry, analytical skills, and a keen eye for detail. My academic journey in the natural sciences<br>
         has uniquely equipped me with a systematic and methodical approach to problem-solving.<br>

         While my background is rooted in the non-technical field of life sciences, my curiosity and passion for technology<br>
         have driven me to pivot towards IT, specifically web development. The analytical skills honed during my studies are<br>
         now being channelled into creating and developing dynamic, user-friendly websites.
